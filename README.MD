# Abstract Sketch Notebooks Plugin

Product design is about so much more than the visuals you create. Abstract Notebooks connect every step of the product design process -- from ideation to execution -- so you can collaborate seamlessly. 

- Add any set of layers or artboards to Notebooks without leaving Sketch.
- Update multiple designs at once with a single click.
- Get feedback exactly when you need it, and control the review workflow start to finish.

This plugin requires an [Abstract Notebooks account](abstract.com).
